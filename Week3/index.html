        <p>Week 1 was a week of learning and experimentation. I learned about the basics of HTML and CSS, and how to use them to create a simple webpage. I also learned about the box model, flexbox, and responsive design. I experimented with different layouts and styles to create a unique and visually appealing webpage. Overall, it was a fun and challenging week, and I'm excited to continue learning and experimenting in the weeks to come.</p>
